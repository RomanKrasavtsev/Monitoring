# Flat File Monitoring
It often happens when we should measure some metrics for a short period of time but we do not have to install any monitoring system for various reasons.

Here we are! And Flat File Monitoring rescues you.

# Metrics

- CPU
- Memory
- VM
- DF

## Network
- Port open

## MySQL

# Todo
- Exit and write error message to the log if any of parameters does not exist
